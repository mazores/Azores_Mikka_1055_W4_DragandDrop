# Drag and Drop Bugs

## Description

Solving the two bugs found in the Drag and Drop exercise done in class. The first bug is solved by making sure that the user cannot drop into the drop zone that already has a piece in it. The second bug is solved by making sure that the puzzle pieces reset when the puzzle is switched to another puzzle.

The first bug was solved but the second bug, despite the number of codes tested in removing child that are now commented out, was not as the dropZones couldn't be read as a parent or the draggable pieces as a child.
